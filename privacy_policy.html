			</section>

			<p>
				This privacy policy applies to the SushiYa! app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Honk Bonk Games (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service.
			</p>

			<hr/>
			<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
			<h4>Information Collected by the Application</h4>

			<p>
				The Service Provider does not collect any personal data from users of the Application.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Application itself does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data.
			</p>
			<br/>

			<p>
				The Application only stores:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Game scores and progress, which are saved locally on your device and are not transmitted to us or any third party.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This data can be removed at any time by uninstalling the Application.
			</p>
			<br/>

			<h4>Information Collected by Third-Party Services</h4>

			<p>
				The Application uses Unity Ads, a third-party service provided by Unity Technologies, to display advertisements.
			</p>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				Unity Ads may collect certain information automatically, which can include:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Device identifiers (such as Advertising ID)</li>
				<li>IP address</li>
				<li>Device information (e.g., device model, OS version)</li>
				<li>Approximate location (derived from IP address)</li>
				<li>Ad interaction data (e.g., views, clicks)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This data is collected directly by Unity, not by us, and is used for purposes such as:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Serving and personalizing ads</li>
				<li>Measuring ad performance</li>
				<li>Preventing fraud</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				For more information, please review Unity's Privacy Policy:
				<a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>
			</p>

			<hr/>
			<h3>How Information Is Used</h3>
			<p>
				As the Application does not collect personal data directly, we do not use, process, or share any personal information ourselves.
				Data collected by Unity Ads is used according to Unity's privacy practices and policies.
			</p>

			<hr/>
			<h3>Data Sharing</h3>
			<p>
				We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties.
				However, Unity Ads may collect and process data independently, as described above.
			</p>

			<hr/>
			<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
			<p>
				The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				If you believe that a child has provided personal data through a third-party service used by the Application, please refer to Unity's Privacy Policy for information on how such data is handled.
			</p>

			<hr/>
			<h3>Data Security</h3>
			<p>
				Because the Application does not collect or store personal data on external servers, there is no personal data stored or processed by us that could be compromised.
				Local game data (such as scores) remains on the user's device and is managed by the operating system's security features.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Any data collected by Unity Ads is handled according to Unity's privacy practices and policies.
			</p>

			<hr/>
			<h3>Opt-Out Rights</h3>
			<p>
				You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. 
				You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Unity Ads provides a method to opt-out of personalized ads. For more information, see <a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy</a>
			</p>
			
			<hr/>
			<h3>Changes</h3>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
			</p>

			<hr/>
			<h3>Your Consent</h3>
			<p>
				By using the Application, you consent to the processing of information by third-party services, such as Unity Ads, as described in this Privacy Policy.
			</p>

			<hr/>
			<h3>Contact Us</h3>
			<p>
				If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at 
				<a href="mailto:honkbonkgames@gmail.com">honkbonkgames@gmail.com</a>.
